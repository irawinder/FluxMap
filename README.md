# FluxMap
Use this open source application to explore empirical urban light data and evaluate accuracy of urban light simulations.

## Features:
1. View Empirical Urban Lighting Data (i.e. lux values from a vehicle sensor)
2. View Empirical Urban Lighting Fixtures (i.e. light poles)
3. Simulate Lighting Data from Models of Lighting Fixtures
4. Compare Fit of Models to Observed Data

# Tactile Matrix
Insights from the project were implemented as an interactive simulation of pedestrian safety conditions at an intersection. This software requires a Tactile Matrix to operate.

## Features:
1. Place your own lighting fixtures at an intersection.
2. View Heatmaps of (a) lighting conditions and (b) simulated safety conditions.

## Interface

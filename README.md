# FluxMap
Use this application to explore empirical urban light data and evaluate urban light simulations models.

# Features:
1. View Empirical Urban Lighting Data (i.e. lux values from a vehicle sensor)
2. View Empirical Urban Lighting Fixtures (i.e. light poles)
3. Simulate Lighting Data from Model of Lighting Fixtures
4. Compare Fit of Model to Observed Data

# Directions:
1. Download Processing (2.2.1) - https://processing.org/download/
2. Clone The Repository
3. Run "FluxMap.pde" using Processing Application
